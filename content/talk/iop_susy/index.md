abstract = "In light of the failed supersymmetry searches at the LHC, with Bayesian statistics, I discuss:  Where is supersymmetry?, and, Is the most constrained supersymmetry model still viable? I briefly review recent experimental results â€“ from collider and astroparticle physics -  that constrain supersymmetry, and explain how we included such results in a Bayesian analysis of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). I identify the best regions in the CMSSM's parameter space and discuss the viability of the CMSSM."
