title = "The Bayes factor surface for searches for new physics"
abstract = "I will discuss the Bayes factor surface - a new way to present results of searches for new physics.  I will begin by explaining my dissatisfaction with existing methods, and then present the Bayes factor surface through examples in cosmology, dark matter and particle physics. I end by making some incomplete remarks on possible computational methods for the Bayes factor surface and connections between the Bayes factor surface and other concepts."
