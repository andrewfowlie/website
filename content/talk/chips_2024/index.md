title = "A cry of distress from Nature? Fine tuning in scientific theories"
abstract = "The parameters in our best theories in fundamental science must be carefully fine-tuned to match experimental observations. Nobel-laureate Steven Weinberg described this fine tuning as 'a cry of distress from nature, complaining that something needs to be better explained' and generations of scientists sought alternative theories that were not fine tuned. Are these fine-tuning arguments truly scientific, however, or are they merely aesthetic judgments?  After a brief historical overview, we explore the concept of fine tuning through data science and reveal the extent to which fine-tuning arguments are grounded in statistical principles. We close by considering whether fine tuning is truly a cry of distress from Nature and whether we expect fine-tuning arguments to remain relevant in science the future."
