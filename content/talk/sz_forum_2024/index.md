title = "The Bayes factor surface"
abstract = "I will discuss the Bayes factor surface - a new way to present results of experimental studies. I will begin by explaining my dissatisfaction with existing methods, and then present the Bayes factor surface through examples from physics and elsewhere, including recent applications in collider physics. I end by making some incomplete remarks on possible computational methods for the Bayes factor surface and connections between the Bayes factor surface and other concepts."
