title = "Bayesian Implications of Current LHC Limits for the Constrained MSSM"
abstract = "I explain how we identify the regions of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model's parameter space that are in best agreement with experimental data, using Bayesian statistics. I show how we construct likelihood functions for experimental constraints, including the latest LHC 1/fb results. I present our probability maps on the ($m\\_0$, $m\\_{1 / 2}$) plane of the CMSSM, with and without the latest LHC 1/fb results."
