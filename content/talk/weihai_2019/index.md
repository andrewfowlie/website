title = "Combined collider constraints on neutralinos and charginos"
abstract = "Searches for supersymmetric electroweakinos have entered a crucial phase, as the integrated luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider is now high enough to compensate for their weak production cross-sections. Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use GAMBIT to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino sector.  We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36/fb of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons.  Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_3^0}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_4^0}$) =  (8--155, 103--260, 130--473, 219--502) GeV and chargino masses of ($m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_1^{\\pm}}$, $m\\_{\\tilde{\\chi}\\_2^{\\pm}}$) = (104--259, 224--507) GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.3\\sigma$, subject to a number of cautions. If one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with 8 TeV proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to $2.9\\sigma$. We briefly consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are decoupled. All samples, GAMBIT input files and best-fit models from this study are available on Zenodo."
