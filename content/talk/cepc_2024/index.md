title = "The status of fine-tuning arguments in the CEPC era"
abstract = "Fine-tuning arguments played a prominent role in motivating searches for new physics at the LHC. After a brief historical overview, we discuss recent criticisms of fine-tuning arguments and recent developments in understanding electroweak fine-tuning [[2406.03533]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03533). We close by discussing the extent to which fine-tuning arguments are relevant to motivating the CEPC and search strategies at the CEPC."
