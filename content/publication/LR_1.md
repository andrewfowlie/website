abstract = "Motivated by a hint in a CMS search for right-handed $W$-bosons in $eejj$ final states, we propose an experimental test of quark-mixing matrices in a general left-right symmetric model, based on counting the numbers of $b$-tags from right-handed $W$-boson hadronic decays. We find that, with our test, differences between left- and right-handed quark-mixing matrices could be detected at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. With an integrated luminosity of about $20/\\textrm{fb}$, our test is sensitive to right-handed quark-mixing angles as small as about $30^\\circ$ and with $3000/\\textrm{fb}$, our test's sensitivity improves to right-handed mixing angles as small as about $7.5^\\circ$. Our test's sensitivity might be further enhanced by tuning $b$-tagging efficiency against purity."
