abstract = "The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) recently released measurements of the electron spectrum with a hint of a narrow peak at about 1.4 TeV. We investigate dark matter (DM) models that could produce such a signal by annihilation in a nearby subhalo whilst simultaneously satisfying constraints from DM searches. In our model-independent approach, we consider all renormalizable interactions via a spin 0 or 1 mediator between spin 0 or 1/2 DM particles and the Standard Model leptons. We find that of the 20 combinations, 10 are ruled out by velocity or helicity suppression of the annihilation cross section to fermions. The remaining 10 models, though, evade constraints from the relic density, collider and direct detection searches, and include models of spin 0 and 1/2 DM coupling to a spin 0 or 1 mediator. We delineate the regions of mediator mass and couplings that could explain the DAMPE excess. In all cases, a heaver than about 2 TeV mediator is required by LEP limits."
