abstract = "We explore the MSSM with 9 free parameters (p9MSSM) that have been selected as a minimum set that allows an investigation of neutralino dark matter and collider signatures while maintaining consistency with several constraints. These include measurement of the dark matter relic density from PLANCK, main properties of the discovered Higgs boson, LHC direct SUSY searches, recent evidence for a Standard Model-like $\\text{BR}(B\\_s \\to \\mu \\mu)$, and the measurement of $\\delta(g-2)$, plus a number of other electroweak and flavor physics constraints. We perform a simulation of two LHC direct SUSY searches at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV: the CMS inclusive $\\alpha\\_T$ search for squarks and gluinos and the CMS electroweak production search with $3\\ell+E\\_T^\\text{miss}{}$ in the final state. We use the latter to identify the regions of the parameter space, consistent at $2\\sigma$ with $\\delta(g-2)$, that are not excluded by the direct limits from the electroweak production. We find that they correspond to a neutralino mass in the window 200 GeV$<m\\_\\chi<500$ GeV. We also implement the likelihood for the XENON100 exclusion bound, in which we consider for the first time the impact of a recent determination of the $\\Sigma\\_{\\pi N}$ term from CHAOS data, $\\Sigma\\_{\\pi N}=43\\pm12$ MeV. We show that in light of this measurement, the present statistical impact of the XENON100 bound is greatly reduced, although future sensitivities of the LUX and XENON1T experiments will have decisive impact on the mixed bino/higgsino composition of the neutralino. We point out some tension between the constraints from $\\delta(g-2)$ and XENON100. Finally, we present prospects for various indirect searches of dark matter, namely $\\gamma$-ray fluxes from dSphs and the Galactic Center at Fermi-LAT, and the positron flux at AMS02. We also show the 5-year sensitivity on the spin-dependent neutralino-proton cross section due to neutrino fluxes from the Sun at IceCube."
