abstract = "We present a new Python module - LHCO_reader - for reading detector-level events in LHCO format generated from detector-simulators such as PGS and Delphes. Emphasis is placed upon ease of use. The module is installed via pip. Once installed, one can read and scrutinize events, with helpful functions and classes for cutting, plotting and inspecting events, and manipulating four-momenta by e.g. boosting. Implementing complicated analyses should be straight-forward by coding any cuts into Python. Furthermore, common kinematic variables, including $\\alpha\\_T$ and razor are included out of the box, and $m\\_{T2}$ and $m\\_{T2}^W$ are provided by interfaces with external libraries."
