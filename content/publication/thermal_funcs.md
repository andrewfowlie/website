abstract = "We provide a small C++ library with Mathematica and Python interfaces for computing thermal functions, defined $$ J\\_\\text{B/F}(y^2) \\equiv \\Re \\int\\_0^\\infty x^2 \\log\\left[1 \\mp e^{-\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\right] \\,\\text{d}x, $$ which appear in finite-temperature quantum field theory and play a role in phase-transitions in the early Universe, including baryogenesis, electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism."
