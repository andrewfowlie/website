Fine-tuning of the weak-scale was traditionally measured by the [Barbieri-Giudice measure](https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(88)90171-X)
$$
\Delta  = \frac{\partial\ln M_Z^2}{\partial \ln m\_{\\textrm{soft}}}
$$
In a series of papers [[1](/publication/cnmssm_2), [2](/publication/cnmssm), [3](/publication/naturalness), [4](/publication/relaxion), [5](hierarchy)], I have argued that our intuitve ideas about fine-tuning are captured formally in Bayesian statistics.
