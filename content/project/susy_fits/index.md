During my PhD I was involved with BayesFits, lead by Prof. Roszkowski. We published high-impact
analyses of simple SUSY models in light of LHC searches for SUSY and the Higgs discovery [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6098), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0264), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1567)].
