Direct detection experiments search for dark matter in interactions with detectors on earth. The relative velocity of dark matter with respect to the detectors is,
however, unknown. In [[1]](/publication/dm), we pioneered the use of Quantified Maximum Entropy to model the uncertainty in the velocity distribution.
